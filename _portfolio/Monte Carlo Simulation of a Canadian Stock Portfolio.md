🧠 **What does uncertainty look like?** Maybe… something like this.

When we think about investing in stocks, ETFs, businesses—whatever it is—there’s always that little voice in our heads:

- "What if it drops tomorrow?"
- "What if I had bought in earlier?"
- "What if I hadn’t sold?"
- "What if... I had known?"

So, I decided to stop ignoring it.

Using a small Python algorithm, I explored **200 plausible futures** of a Canadian stock portfolio 🇨🇦 (RBC, Shopify, TD, Barrick Gold—good old TSX).

📊 Each scenario follows its own path, shaped by:
- **historical data**,
- **expected returns**,
- **volatility**, and
- **correlations** between stocks.

### 🎢 The result: a ballet of curves

- Some paths **skyrocket** 📈  
- Others **plummet** 📉  
- None of them are *the truth*... but **all of them are possible**

- `Python`
- `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`
- `yfinance` for stock market data
