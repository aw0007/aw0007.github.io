### 📚 Reflections

The Nobel isn’t just a celebration of individual achievement. It reflects:

- The **concentration of academic recognition**
- Gaps in **geographic and gender inclusion**

It’s a mirror to how we value knowledge, and a call to keep questioning what — and who — we recognize in science.
