🌍 **Mapping Political Violence in Africa: Insights from ACLED Data (2021–2024)**

This project visualizes political violence events across Africa using the rich, georeferenced dataset from the **Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)**.

I created two main maps:
1. **Event Mapping in West Africa (2021–2024)** – showing the spatial distribution of different types of political violence.
2. **Africa-Wide Event Mapping (2024)** – scaling event markers by the number of reported fatalities to highlight areas of concentrated impact.

### 📌 What These Maps Show

- **Types of Events**: Battles, explosions/remote violence, protests, riots, strategic developments, and violence against civilians.
- **Fatalities Scale**: Bubble size reflects the number of fatalities (e.g., 10, 50, 100, 200+).
- **Conflict Hotspots**: The Sahel region, northeastern Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Sudan emerge as major areas of concern.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- `Python`
- Libraries: `GeoPandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`

### 🔍 Why It Matters

Understanding the **geographic spread and intensity of political violence** is crucial for:
- Policy makers
- Humanitarian organizations
- Conflict researchers

These visualizations provide a data-driven foundation for risk analysis, peacebuilding efforts, and strategic decision-making.
