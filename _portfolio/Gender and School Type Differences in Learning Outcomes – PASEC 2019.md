📊 **Exploring PASEC 2019 Data: Gender and School-Type Differences in Learning Outcomes**

I explored the **PASEC 2019** dataset, which assesses Grade 6 students’ performance in reading and mathematics across several Francophone African countries.

---

### 📈 Visualizations I Created

- ✅ **Boxplots** by gender and country to highlight performance differences.
- ✅ **KDE (density) plots** by school type (public, private secular, private religious).
- ✅ **Facet grids** to compare score distributions across 14 countries.

---

### 🛠️ Methodology

- **Tools**: Python, Pandas, Seaborn, Matplotlib  
- **Data Source**: Programme d’Analyse des Systèmes Éducatifs de la CONFEMEN (PASEC 2019)

### 📚 What the Literature Says

According to **Miningou (2022)**:
- Girls tend to **outperform boys in reading**, while boys perform slightly better in mathematics.
- Using the **Oaxaca-Blinder decomposition**, the study shows that **improving school infrastructure** and increasing **female teacher representation** can reduce the gender gap.

However, **PASEC 2019 remains underexplored** in this area—offering **great potential for future research**.

---

### 🔬 Future Research Directions

- Compare trends between **PASEC 2014 and 2019**
- Investigate **school-level interventions** and **regional disparities**
- Study **teacher characteristics**, **language of instruction**, and **urban-rural divides**
