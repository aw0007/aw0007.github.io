🔍 One of the major goals of market analysis is to understand **how prices move and how trends/cycles emerge over time**.

But explaining these dynamics is tricky—even for practitioners. As any trader will tell you: sometimes, explaining **risk management** to a newcomer is harder than placing the trades themselves! 😅

### 📉 The Reality Behind Price Action

Markets don’t move in straight lines. They **trend**, **consolidate**, and **revert**—these are the rhythms of **price cycles**.

Understanding these movements helps to:
- anticipate momentum shifts,
- design robust trading/hedging rules, and
- make more informed portfolio decisions.

I illustrated this by analyzing **NVIDIA (NVDA)** in **2024** using classic **technical indicators**:
- **SMA20** (short-term trend)
- **Bollinger Bands (20,2)** (volatility envelope)
- **RSI(14)** (momentum)
- **MACD(12,26,9)** (trend/momentum crossover)

### 🧠 Why It Matters

Whether in **cooking**, **medicine**, or **markets**—precision matters.

- In cooking: a wrong dose can ruin the dish.  
- In medicine: a milligram too much can have serious consequences.  
- In trading: misreading a signal or reacting late can deepen drawdowns or miss opportunities.
