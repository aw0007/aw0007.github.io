🌍 **Mapping Political Violence in Africa: Insights from ACLED Data (2021–2024)**

This project visualizes political violence events across Africa using the rich, georeferenced dataset from the **Armed Conflict Location & Event Data Project (ACLED)**.

I created two main maps:
1. **Event Mapping in West Africa (2021–2024)** – showing spatial distribution of violence types.
2. **Continental Overview (2024)** – scaling event markers by reported fatalities to capture impact intensity.

### 📌 What These Maps Show

- **Types of Events**: Battles, explosions/remote violence, protests, riots, strategic developments, and violence against civilians.
- **Fatalities Scale**: Bubble size indicates number of fatalities, from 10 to 200+.
- **Hotspots**: Spatial clustering highlights regions with recurring conflict and violence, notably in the Sahel, Nigeria, Ethiopia, and Sudan.

### 🧰 Tools Used

- `Python`
- Libraries: `GeoPandas`, `Matplotlib`, `Pandas`

### 🔍 Why It Matters

Understanding the **geographic distribution** and **intensity of political violence** is vital for:
- Policy makers
- Humanitarian agencies
- Conflict resolution researchers

These maps offer accessible visual summaries that can support risk assessments, strategic planning, and real-time monitoring.

### 💬 Open to Discussion

I'd love to hear your **feedback** or **collaboration ideas**!  
How can maps like these support better policy, humanitarian response, or conflict prevention?
