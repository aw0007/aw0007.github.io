This study examines the impact of Chinese financial flows on the economic growth of recipient countries, using AidData, which covers 20,985 projects in 165 low- and middle-income countries over the period 2000-2023. We employ three empirical approaches: the within-country estimator, the instrumental variable estimator using China's steel production as an instrument, and the dynamic panel model with the Arellano and Bond specification. Our results indicate a positive relationship between Chinese financial flows and the economic growth of recipient countries. The within-country estimator shows a positive impact, as does the instrumental variable approach, which produces positive and significant coefficients. However, the results of the dynamic panel model are not significant. Long-term effects are evident in five-year averages, particularly in infrastructure-related investments. The positive impact is more pronounced in America than in Africa and Asia. Additionally, our results reveal a crowding-out effect on domestic investment.

### Notes:
**Econometric Model Types**:
   - Within estimators (columns 1–4) are fixed-effects regressions.
   - IV estimators (columns 5–8) use China's steel production as an instrument.
   - AB estimators (columns 9–12) refer to Arellano-Bond dynamic panel models.
     
- Standard errors are in parentheses.
- \* \(p<0.10\), \*\* \(p<0.05\), \*\*\* \(p<0.01\).
- Control variables include savings, gross fixed capital formation (GFCF), FDI, trade openness, primary education, inflation, and rule of law.
- \(N=2148\) in Arellano-Bond (AB) models. Missing data imputed at 10%.
- IV estimation uses China's steel production as an instrument for Chinese financial flows.
