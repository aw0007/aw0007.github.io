This report presents an in-depth analysis of the fundamental factors influencing residential water consumption in Casablanca, Morocco. The study is conducted in two main phases.

In the first phase, the report sheds light on the key factors that shape household water consumption. In the second phase, it examines the potential reasons influencing water conservation behaviors within households to better understand the impact of awareness campaigns. All of this is discussed in the broader context of water stress, drought, and climate change.

On the one hand, based on bivariate and trivariate analysis of variables and an Ordinary Least Squares (OLS) regression, the analysis reveals the influence of socio-economic characteristics on water consumption. Factors such as income, household size, dwelling size, and water cost significantly determine the amount of the water bill. However, age does not have statistical significance in this regard.

On the other hand, using logistic regression and cross-tabulation analysis, the results indicate that radio and social media are the most effective awareness channels, particularly for elderly and young individuals. Regarding motivations for water conservation, the religious dimension emerges as the most frequently cited factor among Casablancan households.

### Key Findings:
- **Socio-Economic Drivers**: Household income, the number of residents, dwelling size, and water costs significantly affect water consumption. Larger households in lower or middle-income brackets often face inequitable pricing, leading to relatively high water bills.
- **Awareness Campaign Channels**: Radio and social media are the most impactful platforms for promoting water conservation, particularly when paired with messages that emphasize religious values.
- **Equity in Water Pricing**: An increase in household size does not necessarily correspond to a proportional increase in income, placing a financial strain on low-income families with high water consumption.

### Policy Recommendations:
- **Targeted Advocacy**: Policymakers should focus advocacy efforts on radio and social media, leveraging religious messages to encourage water conservation.
- **Revised Pricing Policies**: Water pricing should be re-evaluated to ensure fairness, particularly for larger households with limited financial resources.

By addressing these socio-economic and behavioral factors, Casablanca can move toward more sustainable and equitable water management practices, effectively mitigating the challenges posed by water stress and climate change.
