Welcome! I’m **Abdoul Wahid Massaoudou Namata**, an economist and data analyst with expertise in **quantitative analysis**, **econometrics**, **impact evaluation**, and **data science** applied to economic and social issues. I work at the intersection of data, policy, and applied economics, leveraging advanced quantitative tools to generate actionable insights.

### What I Do

- **Data Analysis & Econometrics**: Building and estimating econometric models (cross-sectional, panel data, time series) using tools like **Stata**, **R**, and **Python** to analyze economic, social, and development data.
  
- **Impact Evaluation**: Designing and implementing evaluation strategies including **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**, **Difference-in-Differences (DID)**, **Instrumental Variables (IV)**, and **Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)** to assess policy interventions.

- **Machine Learning & Data Science**: Applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **Random Forests**, **K-Means Clustering**, **DBSCAN**, and **Time Series Forecasting** to large and complex datasets.

- **Big Data Processing**: Cleaning, merging, and processing large-scale datasets using advanced data wrangling techniques (e.g. **fuzzy matching**, text scraping with **OCR** technologies) for applied research and analysis.

- **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, informative, and interactive visualizations using tools like **Python (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)**, **R (ggplot2)**, and **Power BI** to communicate findings effectively.

- **Survey Design**: Developing quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments, including structured and semi-structured questionnaires.

### Tools & Languages

**Python | R | Stata | MATLAB | GAMS | Power BI | QGIS | LaTeX | MS Office**

### Soft Skills

**Problem Solving | Adaptability | Teamwork | Communication | Project Management**

### My Approach

I combine rigorous quantitative methods with a hands-on, problem-solving approach to address complex questions in economics, policy, and development. Whether it’s cleaning messy data, building predictive models, designing evaluation protocols, or presenting results to decision-makers, I aim to bridge the gap between data and actionable insights.
