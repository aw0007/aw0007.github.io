📊 **Tracking Multidimensional Poverty in Africa**  
This visualization compares **deprivations (in % of the population)** across **9 essential dimensions** between **2011 and 2018**, using data from the **Global MPI (OPHI – Oxford)**.

---

### 🗝️ Dimensions Covered:
- Child Mortality  
- Years of Schooling  
- School Attendance  
- Cooking Fuel  
- Sanitation  
- Drinking Water  
- Electricity  
- Housing  
- Assets

### ✅ Key Findings

- **Notable improvements** in access to **electricity**, **education**, and **household assets** in many countries.
- However, **persistent or stagnant deprivation** remains in critical areas like **housing** and **safe drinking water** in others.
- The map provides a powerful snapshot of **country-level progress**, though **inter-country comparisons** should be made cautiously due to context-specific factors.
