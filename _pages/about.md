👋 Welcome! I’m **Abdoul Wahid Massaoudou Namata**, an economist and data analyst with expertise in **quantitative analysis**, **econometrics**, **impact evaluation**, and **data science** applied to economic and social issues. I work at the intersection of data, policy, and applied economics, leveraging advanced quantitative tools to generate actionable insights.

### 🔧 What I Do

- 📊 **Data Analysis & Econometrics**: Building and estimating econometric models (cross-sectional, panel data, and time series) using tools like **Stata**, **R**, and **Python** to analyze economic, social, and development data.
  
- 🎯 **Impact Evaluation**: Designing and implementing evaluation strategies, including **Randomized Controlled Trials (RCTs)**, **Difference-in-Differences (DID)**, **Instrumental Variables (IV)**, and **Regression Discontinuity Designs (RDD)** to assess policy interventions.

- 🤖 **Machine Learning & Data Science**: Applying supervised and unsupervised machine learning techniques such as **XGBoost**, **LightGBM**, **Random Forests**, **K-Means Clustering**, **DBSCAN**, and **Time Series Forecasting** to large and complex datasets.

- 🗂️ **Big Data Processing**: Cleaning, merging, and processing large-scale datasets using advanced data wrangling techniques (e.g., **fuzzy matching**, text scraping with **OCR** technologies) for applied research and analysis.

- 📈 **Data Visualization**: Creating clear, informative, and interactive visualizations using tools like **Python (matplotlib, seaborn, Plotly)**, **R (ggplot2)**, and **Power BI** to communicate findings effectively.

- 📝 **Survey Design**: Developing quantitative and qualitative data collection instruments, including structured and semi-structured questionnaires.

### 💻 Tools & Languages

**Python | R | Stata | MATLAB | GAMS | Power BI | QGIS | LaTeX | MS Office**

### 🌟 Soft Skills

**Problem Solving | Adaptability | Teamwork | Communication | Project Management**

### 🚀 My Approach

I combine rigorous quantitative methods with a hands-on, problem-solving approach to address complex questions in economics, policy, and development. Whether it’s cleaning messy data, building predictive models, designing evaluation protocols, or presenting results to decision-makers, I aim to bridge the gap between data and actionable insights.

### 🎯 Hobbies & Personal Interests

- 🏀 **Basketball & Football**: I enjoy playing team sports that strengthen strategic thinking, coordination, and resilience.
- ♟️ **Chess**: A passion that stimulates logical reasoning and long-term planning.
- 🌍 **Travel**: Exploring new countries and cultures broadens my global perspective.
- 💻 **Programming Projects**: Building personal coding projects that combine data, automation, and creativity.
- 🔬 **Science & Technology**: Following scientific advances and their societal impacts.
- 🤝 **Community Engagement**: Participating in student leadership, event organization, and educational initiatives.
