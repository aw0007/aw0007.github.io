üîç **Project Overview**  

This project applies **systematic backtesting** to evaluate a well-known technical trading rule: the **MACD crossover strategy**, enriched with simple moving averages (SMA 10/20) for trend context.  

Backtesting means simulating how a portfolio would have evolved if a given strategy had been applied to historical price data.  
It allows us to test:  
- when trades would have been triggered,  
- how capital would have grown or declined,  
- and what risk/return characteristics the strategy generates.

### üìâ The Trading Strategy  

The core of the system is the **MACD crossover rule**:  

- **MACD line** = EMA(12) ‚Äì EMA(26)  
- **Signal line** = EMA(9) of MACD  
- **Trading rules**:  
  - **Buy** when MACD crosses above the signal line.  
  - **Sell** when MACD crosses below the signal line.  

Two versions were tested:  
1. **Long-only mode** ‚Üí stay in cash when a sell signal appears.  
2. **Long & short mode** ‚Üí reverse position (switch between long and short) on every crossover.  

In addition, **SMA(10)** and **SMA(20)** are plotted directly on the price chart to provide extra context on short-term trend direction.

### üß∞ Methodology  

- **Assets tested**:  
  Tesla (TSLA), Nvidia (NVDA), Apple (AAPL), Microsoft (MSFT), Amazon (AMZN)  
- **Period covered**: 2015-01-01 ‚Üí 2024-12-31  
- **Data source**: Yahoo Finance (`yfinance`)  
- **Indicators used**: MACD, Signal line, SMA(10), SMA(20)  
- **Tools**:  
  - `backtesting.py` for simulation,  
  - `pandas`, `numpy` for data manipulation,  
  - `TA-Lib` (when available, otherwise custom NumPy EMAs),  
  - `bokeh` for interactive visualization.  

**Technical improvements implemented**:  
- Batch downloading of multiple tickers (reduces Yahoo rate-limit issues).  
- Local CSV caching (avoids unnecessary repeated downloads).  
- Retry logic with exponential backoff.  
- Automatic generation of:  
  - **interactive HTML reports** (equity curve, OHLC, trades, indicators),  
  - **CSV logs** with entry/exit details (time, size, PnL, returns).

### üìä Example Visualization  

<img src="https://aw0007.github.io/images/BACKTESTING/BACKTESTING.png" style="width:95%;" alt="MACD Backtesting Chart" />

**Legend**:  
- OHLC candles = price movements  
- SMA(10) & SMA(20) = short-term moving averages  
- Red/green arrows = trades (entries/exits)  
- Lower panels = MACD line & signal line

### üìà Key Results  

Each run produces a **performance summary** with:  
- Final return & CAGR (annualized growth rate)  
- Annualized volatility  
- Sharpe, Sortino, and Calmar ratios  
- Maximum drawdown (loss from peak to trough)  
- Win rate, average trade return, and profit factor  

Example (TSLA 2015‚Äì2024, long+short):  
- CAGR ‚âà X%  
- Sharpe ratio ‚âà Y  
- Max drawdown ‚âà Z%  
- Profit factor ‚âà ~2.0  

*(exact values vary depending on execution and commission settings)*

### üß† Why It Matters  

This project demonstrates how a **technical trading rule** can be implemented and tested in Python from scratch.  

It shows:  
- how to integrate **market data acquisition**,  
- how to design and code a **strategy class**,  
- how to produce **risk/performance metrics**,  
- and how to visualize both **equity curves** and **indicator dynamics**.  

Even if the strategy itself is relatively simple, the exercise builds a **reusable framework** for testing more advanced trading rules, combinations of indicators, or risk management overlays.

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations & Next Steps  

No backtest is perfect. This study comes with important caveats:  

- **Transaction costs & slippage**: only commissions were modeled; real execution may differ.  
- **Sideways markets**: MACD crossovers can generate many false signals when prices move sideways.  
- **Overfitting risk**: parameters (12, 26, 9) are conventional, but optimizing them excessively risks fitting noise.  
- **Survivorship bias**: only current large-cap stocks were tested; results may not generalize to delisted or smaller firms.  
- **No risk overlays**: position sizing, stop-loss rules, and portfolio constraints were not included.  

**Next steps** could involve:  
- Out-of-sample testing (split data into training/test).  
- Running the strategy on intraday data.  
- Adding volatility filters (e.g., ATR-based position sizing).  
- Combining MACD with other signals (RSI, volume indicators).  
- Portfolio-level backtesting (dynamic allocation between tickers).
